Trivia is an android app where users can play a quiz qith multiple answer questions. The goal of the game is to get the highscore on the leaderboar, which is of course sorted from high to low.

I also added a homescreen where users can select the lenght of the quiz (5/10/15 questions), a level of difficulty (easy/hard/medium) and a category of their liking. 



## Usage
Select duration, difficulty and category of the quiz -> Answer all the questions -> Post your score!
